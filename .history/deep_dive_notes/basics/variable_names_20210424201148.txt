_my_var         # This is a convention to indicate "internal use" or "private" objects.
|               # Objects named this way will not get imported by a statement such as:  from module import *
|----- single underscore



__my_var        # Used to "mangle" class attributes-useful in inheritance chains.
 |
 |--- double underscore



__my_var__      # Used for system-defined names that have a special meaning to the interpreter.  ---  Don't invent them, stick to the ones pre-defined by Python!
