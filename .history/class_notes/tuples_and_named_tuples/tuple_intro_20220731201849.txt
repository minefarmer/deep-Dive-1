                            TUPLES
        Tuples are...
read-only lists...    at list that's how many introductions to python will present tuples!
This isn't wrong, but there's a lot more going on with tuples...
If I think of tuples as read-only lists, I'm missing out on some interesting ideas.

We really need to think of tuples also as data records.          Position of value has meaning.

That is why we are going to start looking at tuples before we even cover sequence types.
