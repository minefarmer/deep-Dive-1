            Immutability of Tuples *****************************
Elements cannot be added or removed.
The order of the elements cannot be changed.
Works well for representing data structures:

    Point: (10, 20)         1'st element is the x-coordinate
                            2'nd element is the y-coordinate

    Circle: (0, 0, 10)      1'st element os the x-coordinate of the center
                            2'nd element is the y-coordinate of the center
                            3'rd element is the radius


This is heterogeneous
City:('London', 'UK' 8_780_000)         The position of the data has meaning.



            Tuples as Data records  *****************************

Think of a tuple as a data record where the position of the data has meaning.
    london = ('London', 'UK' 8_780_000)     -> london is the variable name.

Because tuples, strings and intergers are immutable, we are guaranteed that the data for London will never change.

We can have a list of tuples:       cities = (['London', 'New York', 'Beijing'])


            Extracting data from Tuples  *******************************************************************************

Since tuples are sequences just like strings and lists, we can retrieve items by index.

london = ('London', 'UK', 8_780_000)

city = london[0]        country = london[1]           population = london[2]

The list of cities is homogeneous (contains cities only).
But, a city (the tuple) is heterogeneous.


            Extracting data from Tup0les *******************************************************************************

I can also use tuple unpacking.  ->  covered in the function arguments section.

new_york = (New York', 'USA', 8_500_000)  <-  three values packed in this tuple.

city, country, population = new_york
_____unpacked__tuple____


            Dummy variables  ******************************************************************************************
This is sometin I'm likely to run accross when I look at Python code that uses tuple unpacking.

Sometimes, we are only interested in a subset of the data fields in a tuple, not all of them.

Suppose we are only interested in the city name and population:

city, _, population
