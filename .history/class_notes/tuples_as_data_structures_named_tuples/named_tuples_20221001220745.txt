                    Named Tuples are Immutable

Named tuples are immutable.

If it needs to be updated, I will need to create a new one.

    The _replace instance method.
Named tuples have a very handy instance method, _replace.
It will copy the named tuple into a new one, replacing any values from keyword arguments.
    The keyword arguments are simply the field names in the tuple and the new value.
    The keyword name must match an existing field name.
