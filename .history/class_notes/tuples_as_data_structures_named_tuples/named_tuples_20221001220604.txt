                    Named Tuples are Immutable

Named tuples are immutable.

If it needs to be updated, I will need to create a new one.

    The _replace instance method.
Named tuples have a very handy instance method, _replace.
It will copy the named tuple into a new one, replacing any values from keyword arguments.
    Thr keyword arguments are simply the field names in the tuple and the new value.
