t = (1, 2, 3)   Tuples are immutable: elements cannot be deleted, inserted, or replaced.
    In this case, both the container (tuple), and all it's elements (ints) are immutable.

But consider this:
a = [1, 2]
            Lists are mutable: elements can be deleted, inserted, or replaced.
b = [3. 4]



t = (a, b)      t = ([1, 2])
