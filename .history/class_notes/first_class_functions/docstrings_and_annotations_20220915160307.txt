                    Docstrings and Annotations

We can document our functions (and modules, classes, etc.) to achieve the same result using docstrings   -> PEP 257

If the first line in the function body is a string (not an assignment, not a comment, just a string by itself), it will be interpreted as a docstring.
    def my_func(a):
        "documentation for my_func.     # It is preferred to use triple delimiters.  """ hi """
        return a


            Function annotations
Function annotations give us an additional way to document our functions:  -> PEP 3107

    Where are annotations stored?
In the __annotations__ property of the function
It is a dictionary.
    Keys are the parameter names.
        for a return annotation, the key is return
