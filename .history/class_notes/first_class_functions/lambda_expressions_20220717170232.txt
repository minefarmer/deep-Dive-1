                        Lambda Expressions

            What are Lambda expressions?

We already know how to create functions using the def statement.

Lambda expressions are simply another way to create functions.          anonymous functions

keyword   parameter list -> optional   the : is required, even for zero arguments
        \         \          /    ____/      This expression is evaluated and returned
         \         \        /    /          /           when the lambda function is called
         lambda [parameter list]: expression    (think of it as the "body" of the function)
        |___________________________________|
                        |
        The expression returns a function object.
