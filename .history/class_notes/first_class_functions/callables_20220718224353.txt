                WHAT ARE CALLABLES?

Any object that can be called using the () operator.                callables always return a value.

    like functions and methods,      but it goes beyond just these two ...

many other objects in Python are also callable.

To see if an object is callable, we can use the built-in functon:  callable

callable(print) -> True

callable('abc'.upper) -> True

callable(str.upper)  -> True

callable(callable)  -> True

callable(10) -> false


            Differient Types of Callables  ********************************

built-in functions          print       len     callable

built-in methods            a_str.upper         a_list.append

user-defined functions      created using def or lambda expressions.

methods
