                FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS

Can be passed to  a function as an argument.

Can be returned from a function.

Can be assigned to a variable.

Can be stored in a data structure(such, tuple, dictionary, etc.)



TYPES SUCH AS INT, FLOAT, STRING, TUPLE, LIST AND MANY MORE ARE FIRST-CLASS OBJECTS.

Functions (function) are also first class objects.


ALL FUNCTIONS ARE FIRST CLASS OBJECTS.



HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS ARE FUNCTIONS THAT:

    Take a function as a argument.      (e.g. the simple timer we wrote in the last section)

and/or

    return a function         (plenty of that when we cover decorators in the next section)
