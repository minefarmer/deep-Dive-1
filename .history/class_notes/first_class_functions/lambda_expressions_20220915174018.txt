                    What are Lambda Expressions?
Lambda expressions are simply another way to create functions.      anonymous functions


                                / this expression is evaluated and returned when the lambda function is called. (think of it as the "body")
    lambda [parameter list]: expression
      |         |          |
      keyword   |          : -> is required, even for zero arguments
                optional
