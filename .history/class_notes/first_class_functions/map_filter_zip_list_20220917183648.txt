                    Map, Filter, Zip, List

            Higher order functions
A function that takes a function as a parameter and/or returns a function as it's return value.

Example: sorted  -> is a higher order function.

    map
      \
       -> modern alternative -> list comprehension -> list comprehensions and generator expressions.
      /
    filter


            Map function

map(func, *iterables)
        *iterables -> a variable number of iterable objects.
        func -> some function that takes as many arguments as there are iterable objects passed to iterables.
            Now the only caveat, the only requirement is that func takes in as many arguments as I provide.
map(func, *iterables) will then return an iterator that calculates the function applied
