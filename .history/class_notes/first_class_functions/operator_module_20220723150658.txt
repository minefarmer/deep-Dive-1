                    OPERATOR MODULE
            Functional Equivalents to Operators

In the last lecture we wrote code such as:

l = [1, 2, 3]
reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, l)

I can use a lambda expression to create a functional version of the * operator.

The operator module operator was created for peasants like me.

This module is a convenience module.

I can always use my own functions and lambda expressions instead.  But, I ain't stupid.

add(a, b)
mul(a, b)
pow(a, b)
mod(a, b)
floordiv(a, b)
neg(a)
    (and many more)
