                    REDUCING FUNCTIONS

        Reducing Functions in Python
These ar the functions that recombine an iterable recursively, ending up with a single return value.
Also called accumulators, aggregators, or folding functions.

Example:    Finding the maximum value in an iterable.

a ,  a ,  a ,  ...,  a
 0    1    2          n-1

max(a, b)  -> maximum of a and b

result = a
          0

result = a
          0
result = max(result, a )
                      1
result = max(result, a )
                      2
...
result = max(result, )
                    n-1

        -> max value in a , a , a , ..., a
                         0   1   2        n-1


Because we have not studied iterables in general, we will stay with the special case of sequences.

        Using the Loop.
l = [5, 8, 6, 10, 9]

max_value = lambda a, b: a if a > b else b

def max_sequence(sequence):
    result = sequence
