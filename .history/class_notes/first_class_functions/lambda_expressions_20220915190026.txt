                    What are Lambda Expressions?
Lambda expressions are simply another way to create functions.      anonymous functions


                                / this expression is evaluated and returned when the lambda function is called. (think of it as the "body" of the function)
    lambda [parameter list]: expression
      |         |          |
      keyword   |          : -> is required, even for zero arguments
                optional
   |__________________________________|
                 |
        the expression returns a function object
        that evaluates and returns the expression when it is called.


    Limitations
The "body" of a lambda is limited to a single expression.

No assignments. i.e.    lambda x: x = 5             lambda x: x = x + 5

No annotations          lambda x:int : x*2

single logical line of code     -> line-continuation is OK, but still just one expression.
