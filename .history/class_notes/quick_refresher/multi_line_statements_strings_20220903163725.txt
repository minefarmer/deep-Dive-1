                Multi-line Statements and Strings
    Python Program
---> physical lines of code         end with a physical newline character
    ---> logical lines of code      end with a logical NEWLINE token
        ---> tokenized


    physical newline vs logical newline
        sometimes, physical newlines are ignored
        in order to combine multiple physical lines
        into a single logical line of code
        terminated by a logical NEWLINE token

        Conversion can be implicit or explicit




    implicit
Expressions in:
                                    [1,         [1, #item 1
    list literals: []                2,          2, #item 2
    tuple literals: ()               3]          3  #item 3]
    dictionary literals: {}
    set literals: {}                    def my_func(a,
    function arguments / parameters                 b,
                                                    c:)
                                            print(a, b, c)


        supports inline comments        my_func(10, #comment
                                                20, 30)


I can break up statements over multiple lines explicitly, by using the \ (backslash) character

Multi-line statements are not implicitly converted to  a single logical line.
