                Python Type Hierarchy
                        (subset)

    The following is a subset of the Python type hierarchy that we will cover in this course:

        Numbers
    Integral    Non-Integral
Integers        Floats (c doubles)
Booleans        Complex
                Floats
                Fractions



        Collections
    Sequences                   Sets                    Mapping
Mutable    Immutable      Mutable   Immutable
Lists      Tuples         Sets      Frozen Sets       Dictionaries
           Strings




        Callables                                       Singletons

User-Defined Functions                                  None
Generators                                              Not
Classes
Instance Methods
Class Instances (__call__())
Built-in Functions (e.g. len(), open())
Built-in Methods (e.g. my_list.append(x))
