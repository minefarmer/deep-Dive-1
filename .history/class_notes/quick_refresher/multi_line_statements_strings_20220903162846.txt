---> physical lines of code         end with a physical newline character
    ---> logical lines of code      end with a logical NEWLINE token
        ---> tokenized


    physical newline vs logical newline
        sometimes, physical newlines are ignored
        in order to combine multiple physical lines
        into a single logical line of code
        terminated by a logical NEWLINE token

        Conversion can be implicit or explicit
