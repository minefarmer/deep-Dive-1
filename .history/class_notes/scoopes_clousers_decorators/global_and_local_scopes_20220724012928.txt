                        Scopes and Namespaces

When an object is assigned to a variable    a = 10

    that variable points to some object

        and we say that the variable (name) is bound to that object.

That object can be accessed using that name in various parts of my code.


            But not just anywhere in my code!  ***********************************************************

That variable name and it's binding (name and object) only "exist" in specific parts of my code.

    The portion of code where that name/binding is defined, is called the (lexical scope) of the variable.

    These bindings are stored in (namespaces).      'Each scope has it's own 'namespace'.


            The Global scope.   *****************************************************************************************
The global scope is essentially the module scope.
It spans a single file only.
There is no concept of a truly global scope (across all modules in our entire app) in Python.
The only exception to this are some of the built-in globally available objects, such as:

    True, False, None, dict, print

The built-in and global variables can be used anywhere inside our module, including inside any function.


        Global scopes are nested inside the built-in scope.

            Built-in scope                                            name space

Module1                    name space                               var1        0xA345E
Scope                                                               func1       0xFF34A
    name
    space

                    Module2 scope
                            name
                            space

If I reference a variable name inside a scope and Python does not find it in that scope's namespace - it will look in that enclosing scope's namespace.

    Examples
module1.py              Python does not find True or print in the current (module/globle) scope.

print(True)             So, it looks for them in the enclosing scope -> built-in
                                    Finds them there  -> True


module2.py              Python does not find a or print in the current (module/glogal) scope.
print(a)                So, it looks for them in the enclosing scope -> built-in.  # Then it (looks up) if it can't find it in it's own scope.
                        Finds print, but not a.     -> get run-time Name Error


module3.py
print = lambda x: 'hello {0}!',format(x)
s = print('world')        Python FINDS print IN THE MODULE SCOPE - SO IT USES IT!!!   S -> HELLO WORLD!



            Local Scope **************************************************************************************************************
When we create functions, we can create variable names inside those functions (using assignments).
