            Free Variables and Closures
Remember: Functions defined inside another function can access the outer (nonlocal) variables.

def outer():
    x = 'python'                     this x refers to the one in outer's scope
                                    /this nonlocal variable x is called a free variable.
    def inner():                   /
        print("{0} rocks!".format(x))

    inner()


outer()     -> python rocks!
