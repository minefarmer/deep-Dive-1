            Inner functions
We can define functions from inside another function:

def inner_func():                                               global scope
    # some code                                                                   Nested local scopes
                                                        local (outer_func)
    def inner_func():
        # some code
                                                        local (inner_func)
    inner_func()


outer_func()

Both functions have access to the global and built-in scopes as well as their respective local scopes.
