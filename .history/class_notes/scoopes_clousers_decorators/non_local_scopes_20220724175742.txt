                        Non-local Scopes
            Inner functions
We can define functions from inside another function:

def inner_func():                                               global scope
    # some code                                                                   Nested local scopes
                                                        local (outer_func)
    def inner_func():
        # some code
                                                        local (inner_func)
    inner_func()


outer_func()

Both functions have access to the global and built-in scopes as well as their respective local scopes.

Referencing variables from the enclosing scope.

module.py
a = 10

def outer_func():
    print(a)

outer_func()            When we call outer_func, Python sees the reference to a
                        Since a is not in the local scope, Python looks in the enclosing (global) scope.


Now consider this example:

module.py

def outer_func():
    a = 10

    def inner_func():
        print(a)

    inner_func()

outer_func

When we call outer_func, inner_func is created and called
