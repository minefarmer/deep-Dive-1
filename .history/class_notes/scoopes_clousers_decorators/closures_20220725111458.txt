                    Closures
            Free Variables and Closures
Remember: Functions defined inside another function can access the outer (nonlocal) variables.

def outer():
    x = 'python'                     this x refers to the one in outer's scope
                                    /this nonlocal variable x is called a free variable.
    def inner():                   /
        print("{0} rocks!".format(x)) when we consider inner, we really are looking at:
                                        The function inner
    inner()                             the free variable x (with current value python)


outer()     -> python rocks!            This is called a closure


            Returning the inner function  ****************************************************************
What happens if, instead of calling (running) inner from inside outer, we return it?

def outer():
    x = 'python'                     x is a free variable in inner
                                    /  it is bound to the variable x in outer
    def inner():                   /   this happens when outer runs.
        print("{0} rocks!".format(x))           (i.e. when inner is created)
                                        this is the closure.
   return inner
