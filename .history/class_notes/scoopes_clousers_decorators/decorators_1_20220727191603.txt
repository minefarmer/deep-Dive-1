                DECORATORS

def counter(fn):
    cnt = 0
    def inner(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal cnt
        cnt += 1
        print('{0} has been called {1} times'.format(fn.__name__, cnt))
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner

Note: Using (*args, **kwargs; lines 5 and 9) means we can call any function fn with any combination of positional and keyword-only arguments.

def add(a, b=0):
    return a +   (, which executes )

add = counter(add)      (add points to add on line 14. -> and will return the inner function on line 10. )

result = add(1, 2)       (it will print(Function add was called 1 times) and ( result = 3))

            (We essentially modified our add function by wrapping it inside another function that added some functionality to it.)
            (We also say that we decorated our function add with the function counter.)


In general a decorator function:  *****************************************************************************************
    Takes a function as an argument
    returns a closure
    The closure usually accepts any combination of parameters.
    runs some code in the inner function (CLOSURE)
    the closure function calls the original function using the arguments passed to the closure.
    returns whatever is returned by the function call.


                outer function (fn)     (The outer function defines an inner function)

            inner function
                (*args, **kwargs)               (usually takes a variable number of arguments)
              (inner function does something...)
            (returns fn(*args, **kwargs))


            @ symbol **********************************************************************************************************
                # In our previous example, we saw that counter was a decorator, and we could decorate our add function using:   add = counter(add).

In general, if func is a decorator function, we decorate another function my_func using:  my_func = func(my_func)

This is so common that Python provides a convenient way of writing that:

    @counter                        @func
    def add(a, b):                  def my_func(...):
        return a + b                    ...

# is the same as writing.           # is the same as writing.

def add(a, b):                      def my_func(...):
    return a + b                        ...

add = counter(add)                  my_func = func(my_func)


                Introspecting Decorator Functions

                                                            def counter(fn):
                                                                cnt = 0
                                                                def inner(*args, **kwargs):
                                                                    nonlocal cnt
                                                                    cnt += 1
                                                                    print('{0} has been called {1} times'.format(fn.__name__, cnt))
                                                                    return fn(*args, **kwargs)
                                                                return inner

Lets us the same count decorator

@counter
def mu
