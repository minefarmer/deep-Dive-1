                Modules Recap

        What we've seen sofar...

Modules can be imported using
    the import statement            importlib.import_module

When a module is imported:
    system cache is checked first sys.modules       -> if in cache, just returns cached reference

        otherwise:

    module has to be located (found) somewhere      finders     e.g.  sys.meta.path
    module code has to be retrieved (loaded)        loaders     returned by finder -> ModuleSpec
    "empty" module typed object is created
    a reference to the module is added to the system cache
    module is compiled
