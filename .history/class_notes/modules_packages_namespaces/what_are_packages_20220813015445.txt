                # What are Packages?
        Packages are Modules            (but modules are not necessarily packages)

They can contain
        modules
        packages        (called sub-packages)

If a module is a package, it must have a value set for __path__

After I have imported a module, I can easily see if that module is a package by inspecting the __path__ atriibute   (empty -> module, not-empty -> package)

            Packages and file systems  *********************************************************************
Remember that modules do not have to be entities in a file system.      (loaders, finders)
By the same token, packages do not have to be entities in the file system.
Typically they are - just as typically modules
