                        Semantics!

def my_func(a, b):
    # code here         # In this context, a and b are called parameters of my_func.
                        ! Also note that a and b are variables, local to my_func


        When I call a function:
x = 10                  x and y are called the arguments of my_func
y = 'a'
                        Also note that x and y are passed by reference
my_func(x, y)
                        i. e. the memory addresses of x and y are passed

It's OK if I mix up these terms - everyone will understand what I mean!
