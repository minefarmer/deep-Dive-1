                    Variable Equality
We can think of variable equality in two fundamental ways:

        Memory Address                              Object State (data)

            is                                              ==

        identity operator                           equality operator

        var_1 is var_2                              var_1 == var_2



Negation    is not                                         !=

        var_1 is not var_2                          var_1  != var_2

        not(var_1 is var_2)                      not(var_1 == var_2)


    Examples
                a = 10              a is b -> true
                b = a               a == b -> true


            a = 'hello'             a is b -> true      # but don't count on it!
            b = 'hello'             a == b -> true      # but don't count on it!


            a = [1, 2, 3]           a is b -> false
            b = [1, 2, 3]           a == b -> true


            a = 10                  a is b -> false
            b = 10.0                a == b -> True


    The None object

The None object can be assigned to variables to indicate that they are not set
(in the way we would expect them to be.), i.e. an "empty" value (or null pointer)

The None object is a real object that is managed by the python memory manager.

The memory manager will always use a share3d reference when assigning
