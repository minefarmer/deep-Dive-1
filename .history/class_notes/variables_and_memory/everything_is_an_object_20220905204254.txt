                    Everything is an object

Integers (int)
Booleans (bool)
Strings (str)
Lists(list)
Tuples(tuple)
Sets(set)
Dictionaries(dict)
None(None type)

    Other constructs:
Operators(+, -, ==, is, ...)
Functions
Classes
Types

etc...........


        They all have one thing in common -> they are all objects (instances ofc)
