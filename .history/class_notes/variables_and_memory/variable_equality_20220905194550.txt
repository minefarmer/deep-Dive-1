                    Variable Equality
We can think of variable equality in two fundamental ways:

        Memory Address                              Object State (data)

            is                                              ==

        identity operator                           equality operator

        var_1 is var_2                              var_1 == var_2



Negation    is not                                         !=

        var_1 is not var_2                          var_1  != var_2

        not(var_1 is var_2)                      not(var_1 == var_2)


    Examples
                a = 10              a is b -> true
                b = a               a == b -> true


            a = 'hello'             a is b -> true      # but don't count on it!
            b = 'hello'             a == b -> true      # but don't count on it!


            a = [1, 2, 3]   
            b = [1, 2, 3]
