        The Zen of Python       Tim Peters          import this         PEP 20

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complicated.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Spasce is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practically beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one - and only one - obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
        (The creator of python was a Dutch man named Guido van Rossum.)
Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than 'right' now.
