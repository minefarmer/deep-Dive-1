                Quick Refresher

    Python's type hierarchy

variables

conditionals

functions

loops

break, continue and try

classes




    Variables and Memory

what are variables?  -> symbols for memory addresses

memory

Python memory management  -> reference counting, garbage collection

mutability and immutability  -> function arguments, shared references.

what is the equality of two objects?

Python memory optimizations  -> interning, peephole.




    Numeric Types

integers

rationals

floats   -> binary representations      exactness       rounding       equality     measures of closeness, approximate equality

Decimals  -> alternative to floats    exactness    precision    rounding

complex numbers     -> cmath standard library




    Numeric Types - Booleans

associated Truth values     -> every object has one

precedence and short-circuiting

Boolean operators       -> what they really do
