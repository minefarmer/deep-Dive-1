        A side note on Tuples

(1, 2, 3)

What defines a tuple in Python, is not (), but ,

1, 2, 3     is also a tuple     ->(1,2,3)       Yhe () is used to make the tuple clearer

To create a Tuple with a single element:

(1)     will not work as intended       -> int

1,  or (1, )    -> tuple

The only exception is when creating an empty tuple:       ()



        Packed Values

Packed values refers to values that are bundled together in some way.

Tuples and lists are obvious            t = (1, 2, 3)
                                        l = [1, 2, 3]

Even a string is considered to be a packed value:       s = 'python'

Sets and dictionaries are also packed values:           set1 = {1, 2, 3}
                                                        d = {'a: 1, 'b': 2. 'c': 3}

In fact, any iterable can be a packed value



        Unpacking Packed values

Unpacking is the act of splitting packed values into individual variables contained in a list or tuple.

a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]     3 elements in [1, 2, 3]     -> need 3 variables to unpack.
   | this is actually a tuple of three variables: a, b and c
a = 1   b = 2   c = 3
The unpacking into individual variables is based on the relative positions of each element.
This is how positional arguments were assigned to parameters in a function.



        Unpacking other iterables
a, b, c = 10, 20, 'hello'
                | this is actually a tuple with three values.

a, b, c = 'XYZ'         -> a = 'X'      b = 'Y'     c = 'Z'

instead of writing      a = 10      we can write    a, b = 10. 20
                        b = 20

unpacking works with any iterable type

for e in 10, 20, 'hello'        -> loop returns 10, 20, 'hello'
for e in 'XYZ'                  -> loop returns 'X', 'Y', 'Z'



        Simple Application of Unpacking
swapping values of two variables    a = 10  ->  b = 20
                                    b = 20  ->  a = 10

"traditional" approach
                    a ---------------> 10   0x123
                    b ---------------> 20   0x123
