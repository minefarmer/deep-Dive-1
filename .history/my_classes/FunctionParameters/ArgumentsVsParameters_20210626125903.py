def my_func(a, b):
    # code here             In this context, a and b are called parameters of my_func
                            Also note that a and b are variables, local to my_func


When we call the function:

    x = 10              x and y are called the arguments of my_func
    y = 'a'
                        Also note that x and y are passed by reference
my_func(x, y)
                        i.e. the memory address of x and y are passed


x = 10                      def my_func(a, b):
y = 'a'                         # code here

my_func(x, y)
