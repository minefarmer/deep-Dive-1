        A side note on Tuples

(1, 2, 3)

What dwfines a tuple in Python, is not (), but ,

1, 2, 3     is also a tuple     ->(1,2,3)       Yhe () is used to make the tuple clearer

To create a Tuple with a single element:

(1)     will not work as intended       -> int

1,  or (1, )    -> tuple

The only exception is when creating an empty tuple:       ()



        Packed Values

Packed values refers to values that are bundled together in some way.

Tuples and lists are obvious            t = (1, 2, 3)
                                        l = [1, 2, 3]

Even a string is considered to be a packed value:       s = 'python'

Sets and dictionaries are also packed values:           set1 = {1, 2, 3}
                                                        d = {'a}: 1, 'b': 2. 'c': 3
