"""The operator module
        Functional Equivalents to operators

In the last lecture we wrote code such as:

l = [2, 3, 4]

reduce(lambda a, b: a * b, l)

We used a lambda expression to create a functional version of the * operator

This is something that happens quite often, so the operator module was created

This module is a convenience module

I can always use my own functions and lambda expressions instead
