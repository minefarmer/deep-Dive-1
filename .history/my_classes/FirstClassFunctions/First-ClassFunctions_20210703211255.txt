            First-Class Functions

can be passed to a function as an argument

can be returned from a function

can be assigned to a variable

can be stored in a data structure (such as list, tuple, dictionary, etc.)



Types such as INT, FLOAT, STRING, TUPLE, LIST and many more are first-class objects.



Functions (function) are also first-class objects




            Higher-Order functions are functions that:


take a function as an argument      (e.g. the simple time we wrote in the last section)

    and/or

return a function                   (plenty of that when we cover decorators in the next section)
