"""Reducing Functions in Python
These are functions that recombine an iterable recursively, ending up with a single return value

Also called accumulators, aggregators, or folding functions



        Example: Finding the maximum value in an iterable

a0, a1, a2, ...,, aN-1
max(a, b) _> maximum of a and b

result =a0
result = max(result, a1)
result = max(result, a2)
...
result = max(result, an-1)
    # max value in a0, a1, a2, ..., an-1

the special case of sequences
(i.e. we can use indexes to access elements in the sequence)

        Using a loop
