"""         Decorator Parametors
In the previous ideos we saw some built-in decorators that can handle some arguments:

@wraps(fn)                  @lru_cache(maxsize=256) <\
def inner():                def factorial(n):         \
    ...                         ...                     \>function call


This should look quite differient grom the decorators we have been creating and using:

@timed  <----------- no function call
def Fibonacci(n):
    ..datetime A combination of a date and a time. Attributes: ()
