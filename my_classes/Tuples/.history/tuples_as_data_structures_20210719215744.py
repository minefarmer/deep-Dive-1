        Immutable of tuples
elements cannot be added or removed
the order of elements cannot be changed
works well for representing Data Structures:

Point: (10, 20)     First element is the x coordinate
                    Second element is the y coordinate

Circle: (0, 0, 10)  First element is the x-coordinate of the center
                    Second element is the y-coordinate of the center
                    Third element is the radius
