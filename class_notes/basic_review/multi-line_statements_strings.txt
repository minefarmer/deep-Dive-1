        Python Program

-----------> physical lines of code         end with a physical newline character
    -----------> logical lines of code      end with a NEWLINE token
        ------------> tokenized


physical newline vs logical newline     # they can be the same thing, but, often they are not.

    sometimes, # physical newlines are ignored
    in order to, # combine multiple physical lines
    into a, # single logical line of code
    terminated by a logical NEWLINE token 
    # It is really important to make our code 'human readable'.  # This is for us not the computer.

Conversion can be implicit or explicit

    Explicit

        I can break up statements over multiple lines {explicitly}, by using the \ (backslash) character.

        Multi-line statements are implicitly converted to a single logical line.

        if a \  # Comments cannot be part of a statement, not even a multi-line statement.
           and b \
           and c:  # Can only be after the colon.


    Multi-Line String literals
        """

        """

        '''

        '''

Beware that non-visiable charactors such as newlines, tabs, etc. are actually part of the string-basically anything I type.

    I can use escaped characters (e.g. \n, \t), use string formating etc.

    A multi-line string is just a regular string.

    Multi-line strings are not comments, although thry can be used as such, especially with special comments called docstrings.
