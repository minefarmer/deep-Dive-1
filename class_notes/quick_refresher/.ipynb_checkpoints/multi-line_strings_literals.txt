                Multi-Line String Literals 

Multi-line string literals can be created using triple delimiters (' single or " double)

Be aware that non-visible characters such as newlines' tabs, etc. are vactually part of the string - basically anything I type.

I can use escaped characters (e.g. \n, \t), use string formating, etc.

A multi-line string is just a regular string.

Multi-line strings are not comments, although they can be used as such, especially with comments called docstrings.
