        should follow certain conventions
conventions

_my_var         This is a convention to indicate "internal use" or "private" objects
|
|_____single underscore      Objects named this way will not be imported by a statement such as:
                             from module import *


__my_var      Used to "mangle" class attributes- useful in inheritance chains 
 |
 |____double underscore


__my_var__      Used for system-defined names that have a special meaning to the interpreter. 
 |       |
 |       |
 |___ double underscore    Don't invent them, stick to the ones pre-defined by Python!

                            __init__

                            x < y   ------  x.__lt__(y)


        Other naming Conventions

Packages    short, all-lowercase names. Preferably no underscores.          utilities

Modules     ssort, all-lowercase names. Can  have underscores.              db_utils    dbutils

Classes     Capwords (upper camel case) convention                         BankAccount 

Functions   lowercase, words separated by underscores (snake_case)         open_account

Constants   all)uppercase, words separated by underscores                  MIN_APR
