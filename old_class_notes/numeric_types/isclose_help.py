"""
    Determine whether two floating point numbers are close in value.
    
      rel_tol
        maximum difference for being considered "close", relative to the
        magnitude of the input values
      abs_tol
        maximum difference for being considered "close", regardless of the
        magnitude of the input values
    
    Return True if a is close in value to b, and False otherwise.
    
    For the values to be considered close, the difference between them
    must be smaller than at least one of the tolerances.
    
    -inf, inf and NaN behave similarly to the IEEE 754 Standard.  That
    is, NaN is not close to anything, even itself.  inf and -inf are
    only close to themselves.
